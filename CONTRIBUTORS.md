Contributions are welcome but they do require that you agree to Dropbox's _Contributor License Agreement_ found [here](https://opensource.dropbox.com/cla/).

Fixes that enable compatibility with different IdP implementations are welcome if and only if they do not come at the expense of compatibility with already supported IdPs. `esaml` prefers to follow as closely to the SAML standards as possible.

Bugs/issues opened without patches are also welcome, but might take a lot longer to be looked at.
